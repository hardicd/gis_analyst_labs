## GIS Analyst Labs:

-- Each lab is in a separate folder and has its own readme.md file with instructions.

--Each module is designed to teach a new concept and assess your understanding by uploading your results to the repository.

-- Suggested to git pull the repository to your local machine then as you complete each lab, add/commit/push your required files for each modules assessment section.

-- Feel free to create issues or reach out to me with any questions.

-- Happy coding!
